                <h3>Division 32 (Planetary Science)</h3>

                    <p>In August 2022, I began my first internship at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
                    in La Canada Flintridge, California. I was assigned to their Planetary Science Division
                    to work under Dr. Robert Anderson and Dr. Keith Chin as my primary mentors.
                    <br><br>
                    Originally starting in a team of two co-interns, I focused on the creation of new
                    Python software interfaces for our data acquisition instruments and various motor controlled
                    hardware. Additionally, I took the lead on collecting and processing data from our lunar and martian soil 
                    samples including cone penetration strain, vane shear strength, and ice/water detection. 
                    <br><br>
                    Data collection was also vital for my mentors, as they needed to continuously write proposals and 
                    papers in order to secure more funding for the project. The data that I collected and visualized
                    were put into published papers, mainly written by my mentors and other distinguised scientists.
                    This opportunity allowed me to not only show off my attention to detail when dealing with the 
                    accuracy and correctness of large collections of data, but it also allowed me to be a co-author on a 
                    professional scientific research paper. 
                    </p>
                <h3>(SPARTA) Soil Properties Assessment Resistance and Thermal Analysis</h3>

                    <p>SPARTA is an automated probe designed to test soil penetration strength, shear strength,
                       and water/ice content. Its hardware consists of a load cell, a torque sensor, a dielectric spectrometer,
                       an thermal couple, and an inertial measurement unit.
                    </p>

                    <p>My project assignment focused on data acquisition instrumentation,
                       and software interfacing. 
                       <br><br>
                       In regards to software, I used Python to create a guided user interface from
                       scratch to account for the new experimental SPARTA test benches using new parts.
                       Along with the user interfacing, I also had to work with serial port communication
                       in order to operate the hardware through a combination of Python and an Arduino board. 
                       <br><br>
                       In addition, I got to learn how to work with power
                       supplies and a fair share of electrical wiring to assist my Mechanical Engineering co-intern. This included
                       calibration of voltage in data acquisition devices, connecting relays and an Arduino board 
                       to a linear actuator, and connecting a motor controller to a torque rotary motor.

                <a href="https://www.csun.edu/faculty-affairs"><img src="images\csun_logo.png" width="46%"></img></a>
                    <p>
                        Starting in my first week of college at California State University Northridge, I was able to secure my first part time job
                        as an office student assistant in the Department of Faculty Affairs. 
                        <br><br>
                        My job mainly consisted of:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Answering faculty related questions on the phone</li>
                        <li>Assisting management and organization of form databases (Interfolio, Onbase) </li>
                        <li>Updating webpages on the Faculty Affairs webpage</li>
                        <li>Redirecting calls and emails to the appropriate employee and/or department</li>
                        <li>Managing the main Faculty Affairs inbox account</li>
                        <li>Helping organizing faculty related events (making calendars, setting up conferences, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Delivering gifts and mail around campus</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Faculty Affairs gave me a wonderful and convenient place to work at every
                        week while I attended school. With me being initially very shy, it provided me with a great
                        starting point to break out of my social comfort zone. Whether it be answering a phone,
                        relaying information to my supervisors, or delivering mail, I gradually learned how to profesionally
                        communicate in a workplace environment. 
                        <br><br>
                        The job also showed me how much important work goes into the backend of faculty hiring, 
                        public relations, grievance/issue resolution, document record keeping, and so much more.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, having the workplace building be on campus allowed me to work
                        during my down time in between classes, and also have an exclusive place for privacy and
                        quiet whenever I needed it (i.e. attending an online class, or taking a test).
